# Nia Match - Muslim Marriage Platform MVP

## High-Level Idea
A simple, Islamically compliant marriage platform that connects practicing Muslims globally through personality-based matching and deal-breaker compatibility, with built-in Wali involvement to keep it Halaal.

## Business Model
**Target Market**: Single, practicing Muslims aged 25-35 globally with moderate to high religious commitment.

**Core Problem**: Existing marriage platforms prioritize superficial criteria over deeper religious and personality compatibility, leading to poor matches and dissatisfaction within the Muslim community.

**Revenue Model**: 14-day free trial, then paid subscription to continue using the platform.

## Core MVP Features (Must-Haves)

### 1. Personality-Based Matching System
- **Official Enneagram test** during signup for accurate personality assessment
- **Deal-breaker filters**: Location, aqeedah, living with in-laws, hijrah plans, temperament, hygiene, children preferences, social media presence, references
- **Smart matching algorithm**: Up to 3 matches per week based on Enneagram compatibility + deal-breaker alignment
- **Match display**: Shows Enneagram type, strengths/weaknesses, and deal-breaker preferences (no photos)
- **Rejection handling**: After 5 consecutive rejections, prompt user to review their deal-breakers

### 2. Islamically Compliant Communication
- **Wali-involved group chats**: All communications include a guardian
- **In-app messaging system**: Real-time group chats within the platform
- **No direct messaging**: Maintains modesty and Islamic guidelines
- **Mutual acceptance required**: Both parties must agree before communication begins (before a group chat is created)

## Success Metrics
- **Primary KPI**: 50% of users accept at least one match within 7 days of signup
- **Secondary**: 80% of users receive at least one match within 48 hours

## Key Differentiators

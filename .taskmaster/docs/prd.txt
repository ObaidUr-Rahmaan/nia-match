# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Nia Match - Muslim Marriage Platform MVP

### Introduction

**Problem Statement**
Practicing Muslims seeking marriage face significant challenges in finding compatible partners who align with both their religious values and personality traits. Current marriage platforms prioritize superficial criteria (appearance, income, education) over deeper compatibility factors, leading to poor matches, relationship dissatisfaction, and ultimately failed marriages within the Muslim community.

**Product Vision**
Create a simple, Islamically compliant marriage platform that connects practicing Muslims globally through scientifically-backed personality assessment (Enneagram) and comprehensive deal-breaker filtering, while maintaining Islamic etiquette through mandatory Wali involvement in all communications.
